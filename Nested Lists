Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.








second_is = []
score_is = set()
l = []
x = int(input("Number of Names : "))

for i in range(0,x):
    names = input("Name : ")
    score = int(input("Score : "))
    l.append([names,score])
    score_is.add(score)
# print(score_is)
sorted_ = sorted(score_is)[1]

for name,score in l:
    if score == sorted_:
        second_is.append(name)

for i in sorted(second_is):
    print(f"Second is : {i}")
